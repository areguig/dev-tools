- Local state: Tool-specific inputs and outputs
- Persistent storage: LocalStorage for settings and favorites

### Error Handling
- Input validation for all tools
- Graceful error messages
- Fallback UI for failed operations

### Performance
- Code splitting by tool category
- Lazy loading for tool components
- Optimized bundle size for GitHub Pages

### Free APIs to Consider
- TinyURL API (URL shortening)
- QR Server API (QR code generation)
- JSONPlaceholder (for testing/demo purposes)

## Success Metrics
- All planned tools functional and tested
- Responsive design working on mobile/desktop
- Fast loading times (<3s initial load)
- Accessible to users with disabilities
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages

## Timeline Estimate
- **Week 1**: Checkpoints 1-2 (Foundation + Core Tools)
- **Week 2**: Checkpoints 3-4 (Advanced Tools + Crypto)
- **Week 3**: Checkpoints 5-6 (API Integration + Utilities)
- **Week 4**: Checkpoints 7-8 (UX + Deployment)

# New Task: Add Sharing Feature to Remaining Tools

## Overview
Add sharing functionality to all tools that don't currently have it. The sharing feature includes:
- Import statements for ShareWidget and useShareTrigger hook
- Hook initialization with appropriate tool name
- triggerShare() calls in functions that produce substantial output
- ShareWidget component at the end of the return statement

## Tools to Update (Priority Order)
1. [x] HashTool.tsx - "Hash Generator"
2. [x] JWTTool.tsx - "JWT Token Decoder" 
3. [x] URLTool.tsx - "URL Encoder/Decoder"
4. [x] UUIDTool.tsx - "UUID/GUID Generator"
5. [x] RegexTool.tsx - "Regex Tester"
6. [x] PasswordTool.tsx - "Password Generator"
7. [x] QRCodeTool.tsx - "QR Code Generator"
8. [x] ColorTool.tsx - "Color Palette Generator"
9. [x] TimestampTool.tsx - "Timestamp Converter"

## Implementation Pattern for Each Tool

### 1. Add Imports
```typescript
import ShareWidget from '../components/ShareWidget'
import { useShareTrigger } from '../hooks/useShareTrigger'
```

### 2. Add Hook in Component
```typescript
const { isVisible: shareVisible, hideShare, triggerShare } = useShareTrigger({
  toolName: 'TOOL_NAME_HERE'
})
```

### 3. Add triggerShare() Calls
- Add to functions that produce substantial output
- Include length/quality checks to avoid triggering for empty or minimal results
- Follow patterns from Base64Tool and JSONTool

### 4. Add ShareWidget Component
```typescript
<ShareWidget
  toolName="TOOL_NAME_HERE"
  isVisible={shareVisible}
  onClose={hideShare}
/>
```

## Success Criteria
- All tools have consistent sharing implementation
- triggerShare() only called for substantial/successful output
- ShareWidget properly positioned in each tool
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## ✅ COMPLETED - All 9 Tools Updated

### Summary of Changes
All priority tools have been successfully updated with sharing functionality:

1. **HashTool.tsx** - Triggers share when hash is generated (text or file)
2. **JWTTool.tsx** - Triggers share when JWT token is successfully decoded
3. **URLTool.tsx** - Triggers share when encoding/decoding produces substantial output
4. **UUIDTool.tsx** - Triggers share when UUIDs are generated
5. **RegexTool.tsx** - Triggers share when regex finds matches
6. **PasswordTool.tsx** - Triggers share when password is generated successfully
7. **QRCodeTool.tsx** - Triggers share when QR code is successfully generated
8. **ColorTool.tsx** - Triggers share when color palette is generated
9. **TimestampTool.tsx** - Triggers share when timestamp conversion is successful

### Implementation Details
Each tool now includes:
- Import statements for ShareWidget and useShareTrigger hook
- Hook initialization with appropriate tool name
- triggerShare() calls in functions that produce substantial output
- ShareWidget component positioned before the closing div
- Length/quality checks to avoid triggering for empty or minimal results

### Notes
- Changes were kept minimal and focused
- Followed existing patterns from Base64Tool and JSONTool
- All implementations maintain existing functionality
- Sharing is triggered only for successful, substantial operations
