## Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture
- Shared components: Layout, Navigation, ToolCard, CopyButton
- Tool-specific components: Each tool as self-contained component
- Utility functions: Separate helper functions for encoding, formatting, etc.

### State Management
- Global state: Theme preference, user settings
- Local state: Tool-specific inputs and outputs
- Persistent storage: LocalStorage for settings and favorites

### Error Handling
- Input validation for all tools
- Graceful error messages
- Fallback UI for failed operations

### Performance
- Code splitting by tool category
- Lazy loading for tool components
- Optimized bundle size for GitHub Pages

### Free APIs to Consider
- TinyURL API (URL shortening)
- QR Server API (QR code generation)
- JSONPlaceholder (for testing/demo purposes)

## Success Metrics
- All planned tools functional and tested
- Responsive design working on mobile/desktop
- Fast loading times (<3s initial load)
- Accessible to users with disabilities
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages

## Timeline Estimate
- **Week 1**: Checkpoints 1-2 (Foundation + Core Tools) ✅
- **Week 2**: Checkpoints 3-4 (Advanced Tools + Crypto) ✅
- **Week 3**: Checkpoints 5-6 (API Integration + Utilities) ✅
